# House Rules

In order to keep a game session from dragging on, I will list some house rules that I feel may address this issue.  Note that this may change over time depending on if I am sensing the rules are either not working to address the issue or if they are being too restrictive.

## Rationale

I understand that a lot of us love to analyze the situation in order to take the most effective action.  But I also believe that "analysis paralysis" is a real thing, and it can negatively impact the game.  (This is why all of us do the "nose goes" thing.)  I feel that keeping the combat snappy can mitigate some of this, and can even produce some unintended fun side-effects, particularly if the player is forced to think on his/her feet from time to time. Hopefully my house rules provide a good balance between analyzing the situation and winging it.

## Metagame discussion time

At the start of each round, the party will have 2 minutes to discuss strategies for the given round.  This can be things like the approach the group would like to take as a whole, and the goals for each individual player.  Ideally I would like this to be the planning phase and the actual turns to be the execution phase.  Of course things do not always go according to plan, so it is important to pay attention during the turn order so you can prepare a alternate action or strategy if this happens.  You can ask the DM various questions about the combat environment during this phase or the turn phase, but note that some requests will require you to roll for it as your turn action if you want to pursue that.

## Turn limit timer

I will announce who's turn it is, and who is up next.  When it is your turn, you have 1 minute to perform your action.  Ideally you should already know what action you will perform and your target.  I will be lenient if you need to clarify something (like weapon/skill abilities) with the DM, but please do not try to use this as a stall tactic to have more thinking time.  If the minute passes and the action has not been performed, I will have your character perform a dodge action, if applicable.  Also I understand if an emergency happens that makes someone go AFK and we can work around this.

## One last thing..

Remember that it is perfectly fine to make mistakes.  Bad consequences are still part of framing the adventure, and can even turn into a good thing under the right circumstances.
